# scripts

BackupDrive
This directory contains the scripts used in keeping certrain directories and drives synced up with my portable hard drive that is kept off-site.

Excel_Stock_Quote
These scripts are used in my Excel workbook to download stock & mutual fund quotes.  The functions in "GetPriceModule.bas" are designed to be called by the workbook open event so that these are only called once, when the workbook is first opened.
