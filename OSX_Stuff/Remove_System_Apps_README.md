While booting the MAC, hold the Command+R keys as you switch on the machine.  This will boot to recovery.

Once the main utilities window opens up, on the menu bar click "Utilities".  Select the Terminal

Execute command:
csrutil disable

Reboot the machine

In OSX, remove the first-party system apps you don't want (News, AppleTV, etc, etc.)

Repeat from top to go into recovery mode -> terminal and run the command:
csrutil enable

Reboot

Profit.
